We are Ledgy, a SaaS startup from Zurich, looking for a software engineer to grow our team.

Ledgy is a SaaS tool to manage the equity of private companies. It helps to democratize ownership in startups by assisting founders to grant equity to their employees. We’ve also developed a first concept to bring shares of startups on the Ethereum blockchain.

Our [customers](/) are successful companies from Switzerland and other European countries, like VIU, Farmy, or the Crypto Finance AG.

We are a young team that graduated from ETH Zurich in 2017. All of our code is developed in-house, by us. We are inspired by the startup scene and hacker spirit in Silicon Valley and want to bring this vibe to Switzerland. (We have once been [invited](https://blog.ledgy.com/our-interview-at-y-combinator-e1131fd89ecc) to Y Combinator for an interview.)

We closed our €1m [seed round](https://www.eu-startups.com/2018/12/ledgy-raises-funding/) in December 2018 with a group of exciting investors. Our institutional investors have been selected as the [digital shapers](https://www.bilanz.ch/people/investors) of 2018 by Bilanz magazine. Our angel investors invested in startups like Facebook, BlaBlaCar, and SumUp, and have previously founded Doodle.com. Since 12 months after our incorporation, we are listed among the [TOP 100](https://www.top100startup.ch/index.cfm?CFID=30662266&CFTOKEN=5d1c365fa7651b6b-C39A8E03-C967-5D24-C2B1A2E98BD73FA6&page=136340&profilesEntry=1) of Swiss startups.

We love giving back to the community. Thus, we have developed an open source [​two-factor authentication​](https://blog.meteor.com/tutorial-two-factor-authentication-with-meteor-and-totp-21d4a2f9ee51), a modern [​landing page with GatsbyJS​](https://github.com/morloy/ledgy.com), a [​blockchain notary​](https://blog.ledgy.com/the-ledgy-blockchain-notary-3fb3dc423aae).
