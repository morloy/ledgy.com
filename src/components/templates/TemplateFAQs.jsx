      <Trans>
        Currently, setting up an employee participation plan costs thousands to set up. With the
        help of these templates and guides you can finalize it for a fraction of the time and cost.

        Create a pool and add the grants directly in Ledgy. Ledgy will then keep track of the
        vesting schedule for you and send you notifications for important events (cliff, vesting,
        expiry).
